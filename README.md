# Python-Examples

I learn best by teaching others, so I end up writing tutorials/examples to myself. I'll keep adding files as I produce them. Feel free to email me with any questions, concerns or ideas at sean@jesuisharpua.com. I'll be posting the tutorials on my blog as well. You can find it at [jesuisharpua.com][1]

## Examples (in order of appearance)

1. example-gnupg.py
  * Use GnuPG to encrypt a file and FTP it to a remote server. Full tutoral [here][2].
2. example-class.py
  * An Employee class demonstrating the use of class attributes, instance attributes, `@property`, `@staticmethod`, `__str__` and `__repr__`.
3. example-decorator.py
  * A function decorator that ensures a database connection exists before attempting to execute a query. 
4. example-duck_typing.py
  * The canonical example of duck typing.
