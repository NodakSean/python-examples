# Python-Examples

I learn best by teaching others, so I end up writing tutorials/examples to myself. I'll keep adding files as I produce them. Feel free to email me with any questions, concerns or ideas at sean@jesuisharpua.com. I'll be posting the tutorials on my blog as well. You can find it at [jesuisharpua.com][1]

## Examples (in order of appearance)

1. example-gnupg.py
  * Use GnuPG to encrypt a file and FTP it to a remote server. Full tutoral [here][2].
